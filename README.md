# GAME IDEAS

## ***Idea 1***

### **The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth**

Classic ruguelike game with lots of random elements, use WASD to move up, down, left, right, and use the arrow keys to fire bullets (tears)!

Earn random drops or pedestal props by defeating bosses or clearing rooms.

A combination of multiple props may have an unexpected effect! (This is definitely the charm of the game!)

### Twist：

Some of the new props and resources, and the effects of combining them with other items (might need an update to the underlying logic?).

### Challenges:
    
    1.Map generation: Need to make sure the map makes sense while random elements are added.

    2.Enemy behaviour: Ensure the enemy's aggressiveness or behavioural coherence.

    3.Combination of multiple props.

## ***Idea 2***

### **Hollow Knight**

Horizontal Crossing Game with gravity. Fixed map and enemies, defeat enemies by attack or skill. Main character has more movement, turning left and right, attacking, jumping (two jumps), skills (maybe?), etc.

### Twist：

expect brand new skills and boss?

### Challenges:
    
    1.Map design: need to focus on interaction with the protagonist.

    2.Enemy behaviour: some actions which follow a certain logic.

    3.Character movement articulation: including attack, skill, hit and hostile character effects.
